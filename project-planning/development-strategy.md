# Do-It-Yourself Wiki

- A simplified wiki to create, read and update pages in a markdown wiki.

- Most of the code is already written.

- The task is to write the piece between the server and the file system like reading, writing and updating saved files in the PC.

- There are five routes in this project:
  
  - Get an existing page
  - Post a new page
  - Get all page names
  - Get all tags
  - Get page names by tag
